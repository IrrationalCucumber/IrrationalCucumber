              Hi there! Welcome to my personal portfolio. I am a student of
              Information Techonolgy. I am skilled in both in frontend and
              backend development, although I would say I am not the best at it.
              But I am passionate about it and would love to learn new things
              for this career. Though my journey is still in starting, I am
              looking forward to the challenges and better myself and try new
              things in this industry.

              I am interested in Web development and Software development as I 
              realized how intricate and detailed the design of a web application or
              an software while studing for this career.
